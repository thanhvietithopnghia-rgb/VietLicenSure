# Computer Configuration and Software License Check Tool — Version History

This document summarizes the core changes in the main public releases.

Current ManagedSigned release: **v5.0.0.0 — Stable R8 (self-signed exception)**
FileVersion: **5.0.0.0** · Build **2026.08.26**

A separate `StoreSubmission` candidate is being prepared for Microsoft Store and has not been released. It binds trust to Store package identity/origin and routes elevation through the compiled launcher so the UAC boundary remains fail-closed.

## v5.0.0.0 — August 30, 2026 — ManagedSigned Stable R8

- **Runs on a new PC:** fixes `Authenticode=0x800B0109` when the author's self-signed certificate is not preinstalled.
- **Tamper checks remain strict:** only `CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT` is accepted after both the signer SHA-1 thumbprint and certificate SHA-256 match the pinned release identity.
- **Modified files remain blocked:** changed content returns `HashMismatch`/`TRUST_E_BAD_DIGEST`; a different signer, certificate, or trust error is never bypassed.
- **PowerShell failures are visible:** the launcher shows the child-process exit code when security policy or a missing component prevents the interface from opening.
- **R7 requires a manual replacement:** R7 and R8 share file version `5.0.0.0`, and ManagedSigned keeps public self-update disabled.
- **Windows may still warn:** this is a disclosed self-signed exception rather than a public-CA identity, so SmartScreen can show `Unknown publisher` on a new PC.

## v5.0.0.0 — August 27, 2026 — ManagedSigned prerelease (Preview R6 hotfix)

- **Scan-source and UAC bridge fix:** ManagedSigned repair now accepts the trusted managed state; process failures and missing result files surface explicit diagnostics instead of a generic data-read error.
- **Safe recovery path:** the software inventory remains read-only when scan sources are incomplete, while a **Repair scan sources** action can repair and rescan before eligible remediation is unlocked.
- **Scope-consistent results:** the UI explains that Windows, Microsoft Office, and other software use separate assessment sources, so differing conclusions are expected rather than silently merged.
- **No clipped labels:** headings, summaries, and Vietnamese/English guidance wrap within narrow or high-DPI windows; a clear message is shown when no item has enough evidence for direct remediation.
- **Regression gate:** adds a ManagedSigned bridge probe and synchronizes the bilingual verifier/message chain. R6 remains a ManagedSigned Preview, not public-CA Stable.

## v5.0.0.0 — August 26, 2026 — ManagedSigned prerelease (Preview R5, baseline — superseded by R6)

- **R5 supersedes R4:** R4 was withdrawn before broad release because the launcher BuildId did not match the embedded Bridge/provenance identity; R5 was rebuilt from source with all release artifacts and metadata replaced.
- **Unified build identity:** the launcher, embedded Elevated Bridge, manifest, and provenance use the canonical BuildId `5.0.0.0-production-20260826`; the release label is `5.0.0.0-managed-signed-20260826`.
- **Post-compile verification:** the build chain rechecks the EXE, embedded Bridge, provenance, and source snapshot; any identity mismatch or dirty worktree stops release creation.
- **SBOM and supply chain:** adds a CycloneDX 1.5 `SBOM.cdx.json` whose SHA-256 is recorded in the release manifest; GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs and mutable tag/branch references are rejected.
- **Explicit ManagedSigned state:** Authenticode, an RFC 3161 timestamp, and CMS provenance are verified on machines that trust the managed certificate; system-changing actions open only after both WinVerifyTrust and provenance succeed. Public self-update remains disabled, and this is not public-CA Stable.
- **Three scan levels:** Quick, Standard, and Deep use explicit budgets with safe root, include, and exclude limits.
- **Catalogs and plugins:** exposes Fresh/Warning/Stale/Future/Invalid states; external plugins accept only CMS-signed declarative metadata from administrator-pinned publisher fingerprints.
- **Responsive UI:** preserves the responsive R4 interface, with compact navigation when the sidebar is hidden, content-aware tile heights, bounded scrolling on short screens, and clipping checks for Vietnamese/English controls; system-aware themes, Light/Dark overrides, and PerMonitorV2 DPI remain supported.
- **Five remediation workflows:** Windows, Microsoft Office, other software, OEM key recovery, and valid-license management.
- **Scope-locked remediation:** Windows, Office, and other-software workflows open their dedicated screens directly; scope stays fixed through Dry Run, backup, confirmation, execution, and post-check. The combined Overview remains available.
- **Enterprise synchronization:** Server/Workstation interfaces inherit version `5.0.0.0` from the launcher; new resources use v5.0 names while cleanup remains compatible with legacy v4.8/v4.6 resources.
- **Deployment and export:** supports a headless CLI, Intune/MDM scripts, and fleet JSON/CSV/HTML/PDF export with redaction and CSV-injection safeguards.
- **Cleaner interface:** removes the redundant sidebar version line and "software catalog: fresh/latest" status line while retaining freshness enforcement, warning colors, and catalog tooltips.
- **Transparent test scope:** current evidence records an automated pass on current Windows 11/25H2; Windows 10 22H2 and the previous Windows 11 target are still missing runners, so the VM matrix remains incomplete. A public-CA release still requires the full Windows matrix and an independent security review.

## v4.9.0.0 — August 22, 2026

- **More accurate recognition:** inventories Registry, AppX/MSIX, WinGet, shortcuts, package managers, and bounded portable locations; distinguishes confirmed installations from portable/residual files and merges duplicate records by product family.
- **Adaptive integrity scanning:** vendor host blocks or disabled licensing services trigger broader Authenticode checks within the exact product directory; evidence no longer leaks between products from the same vendor.
- **Diagnosable licensing and safe remediation:** unreadable data is distinct from unactivated status; reports are read-only; remediation removes only the selected bad key/Activation ID, preserves coexisting genuine licences, and verifies the exact selected scope afterward.
- **Controlled complete uninstall:** an application can be fully removed only after explicit selection and validation of a source-bound MSI/AppX identity; the preview, backup, execution result, and absence post-check remain mandatory.
- **Protected release chain:** the EXE, provenance, catalog, and update manifest are signed; online comparison accepts declarative data only from pinned official sources and uploads no software inventory or device data.
- **Policy from v4.9:** the Tool remains free and community-oriented; source is no longer published free of charge, is not open source, and requires the author's prior written approval for access.

## v4.8.0.0 — August 10, 2026

- **Broad inventory and assessment:** expanded Windows, Office, third-party software, and hardware checks while separating licence model, technical state, and confidence.
- **Deep scan and signed catalog:** introduced multi-tier evidence and `Unverified` outcomes to avoid conclusions when data is incomplete.
- **Controlled remediation:** scope selection, preview, confirmation, backup, and post-verification are mandatory; weak evidence never removes software or changes the system automatically.
- **Usability:** completed the Dashboard, HTML/PDF reports, local Assistant, and server–workstation management while keeping Offline as the default.

## v4.6 — August 6, 2026

Focus: no-change remediation simulation, broader engineering-software recognition, and an isolated data lifecycle instead of sharing the v4.4/v4.5 write root.  
Platform/technology: C#/.NET Framework 4 AnyCPU; Windows PowerShell 3+/WinForms; JSON catalog 1.2; DataSchema 2.0; SHA-256/HMAC/DPAPI; LAN HTTP with AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 application envelopes.

- Expanded the software catalog to `1.2.0.0` with 45 product rules, including 16 CAD/CAM/CAE, BIM, simulation, structural, GIS, EDA, measurement, and rendering groups. Unknown products still use the vendor-neutral deep scanner.
- Added a deep-scan performance hotfix with per-directory caching, lighter .NET enumeration, a reusable Authenticode runspace pool, and an adaptive 6/3/1 signature profile by risk. Source scope, depth, artifact inspection, and correlated system evidence are unchanged, and all limits remain reportable.
- Added **Dry Run** for KMS/Activator remediation. It lists the exact file, Registry, service, task, KMS/key, MSI Repair, or uninstall action plus backup/restorability without creating a restore point, backup, or system change. Real execution reopens item selection and requires confirmation again.
- Fixed online-catalog consent to fail closed: omitted consent or explicit `false` exits with code `2` before any network operation, and the wrapper no longer replaces the caller's value with `true`.
- Reduced unauthenticated `GET /tool/v1/status` to exactly `Accepted`, `ProtocolVersion`, and `ToolVersion`; server identity, addresses, bind settings, CIDRs, and client counts are not disclosed. Business endpoints retain authenticated envelopes and rate limiting.
- Moved writable state to `%ProgramData%\ThanhViet-Tool-Kiem-Tra\v4.6`, with `DataSchemaVersion=2.0`, `ProducerVersion`, a migration lock, and machine-readable state. Migration uses a staging copy, SHA-256 verification, transactional commit, and rollback; v4.4/v4.5 data remains unchanged, while old logs/backups are read-only references.
- Added v4.6 launcher, Enterprise agent, and audit mutexes, with launcher-side detection of an active v4.4/v4.5 process before migration. Old cryptographic labels remain only as compatibility identifiers for migrated timeline and secret material.
- Synchronized v4.6 across module/report/safety/capability/catalog metadata, documentation, User-Agent, and verifiers. Added `VERIFY-DATA-LIFECYCLE.ps1` for one-time migration, legacy preservation, idempotency, and rollback fixtures.

## v4.5 — August 6, 2026

- Completed the shared Light/Dark visual system, colored action icons, DPI-aware text layout, and the new product name **Computer Configuration and Software License Check Tool**.
- Inventories all software found through Uninstall Registry data, AppX/MSIX, Start Menu, Desktop, and bounded installed/portable locations; compares licensing models and technical evidence without treating “no evidence” as genuine.
- Added a vendor-neutral deep scan for every detected application: multiple EXE/DLL Authenticode checks, trusted known-bad hashes, artifacts, and correlated system tampering evidence; weighted signature budgeting preserves broad coverage while prioritizing paid/trial/evidence-bearing software, and incomplete coverage is reported explicitly.
- Added **Connect online**, with an explanation and explicit consent before downloading a fixed HTTPS comparison catalog; no application inventory, paths, keys, or tokens are uploaded, and Offline remains the default.
- Lists all other-software results and allows individual or Select-all handling for every Non-genuine/Suspicious scope; backup is mandatory before reset, Repair, cleanup, or manual uninstall/reinstall actions.
- Makes every Non-genuine/Suspicious application manually selectable and adds a generic scope-locked plan for exact artifact quarantine, hosts restoration, validated MSI Repair, or manual uninstall for an official reinstall. Automatic mode never uninstalls software.
- Split scanning into All, Windows and Office, and Other software scopes; extended Backup/Restore to the same scopes; added timeouts, heartbeats, and on-demand HTML/PDF generation to reduce apparent hangs.
- Optimized all 44 embedded payloads by choosing Deflate or raw per resource, then decompressing and verifying SHA-256 before launch without removing a module or reducing scan coverage.
- Rewrote the synchronized Vietnamese/English v4.5 end-user guides in the task-by-task style used by v4.4: what changed, how to run the EXE, all ten tasks, software status, deep scanning, safe remediation, reports, and troubleshooting; packaging internals were removed from the user guide.

## v4.4 — July 31, 2026

- Added safe automatic remediation for allowlisted, backup-capable items, with preview, confirmation, protected backup, and post-scan verification.
- Completed Vietnamese/English localization across the dashboard, dialogs, reports, and child modules while preserving language-neutral machine status codes.
- Refreshed the Fluent-style dashboard, Inspect/Remediate/Reports filters, Settings dialog, and bundled vector icons for Light/Dark modes.
- Optimized bounded Office/file scanning and added Copy full log, Open report folder, and non-blocking VM/Remote Desktop notices.

## v4.3 — July 30–31, 2026

- Introduced the KMS/Activator remediation center with preview, confirmation, backup, and post-checks.

## v3.9 — July 22, 2026

- Upgraded reports to schema 1.3, added fallback scan sources, and made schema verification a release gate.
