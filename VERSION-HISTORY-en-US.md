## v4.9.0.0 — August 22, 2026

- **More accurate recognition:** inventories Registry, AppX/MSIX, WinGet, shortcuts, package managers, and bounded portable locations; distinguishes confirmed installations from portable/residual files and merges duplicate records by product family.
- **Adaptive integrity scanning:** vendor host blocks or disabled licensing services trigger broader Authenticode checks within the exact product directory; evidence no longer leaks between products from the same vendor.
- **Diagnosable licensing and safe remediation:** unreadable data is distinct from unactivated status, CIM/WMI fallbacks are used, elevation is requested when necessary, and changes require direct evidence plus a post-check.
- **Protected release chain:** the EXE, provenance, catalog, and update manifest are signed; online comparison accepts declarative data only from pinned official sources and uploads no software inventory or device data.
- **Policy from v4.9:** the Tool remains free and community-oriented; source is no longer published free of charge, is not open source, and requires the author's prior written approval for access.

## v4.8.0.0 — August 10, 2026

- **Broad inventory and assessment:** expanded Windows, Office, third-party software, and hardware checks while separating licence model, technical state, and confidence.
- **Deep scan and signed catalog:** introduced multi-tier evidence and `Unverified` outcomes to avoid conclusions when data is incomplete.
- **Controlled remediation:** scope selection, preview, confirmation, backup, and post-verification are mandatory; weak evidence never removes software or changes the system automatically.
- **Usability:** completed the Dashboard, HTML/PDF reports, local Assistant, and server–workstation management while keeping Offline as the default.

## v4.6 — August 6, 2026

Focus: no-change remediation simulation, broader engineering-software recognition, and an isolated data lifecycle instead of sharing the v4.4/v4.5 write root.  
Platform/technology: C#/.NET Framework 4 AnyCPU; Windows PowerShell 3+/WinForms; JSON catalog 1.2; DataSchema 2.0; SHA-256/HMAC/DPAPI; LAN HTTP with AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 application envelopes.

- Expanded the software catalog to `1.2.0.0` with 45 product rules, including 16 CAD/CAM/CAE, BIM, simulation, structural, GIS, EDA, measurement, and rendering groups. Unknown products still use the vendor-neutral deep scanner.
- Added a deep-scan performance hotfix with per-directory caching, lighter .NET enumeration, a reusable Authenticode runspace pool, and an adaptive 6/3/1 signature profile by risk. Source scope, depth, artifact inspection, and correlated system evidence are unchanged, and all limits remain reportable.
- Added **Dry Run** for KMS/Activator remediation. It lists the exact file, Registry, service, task, KMS/key, MSI Repair, or uninstall action plus backup/restorability without creating a restore point, backup, or system change. Real execution reopens item selection and requires confirmation again.
- Fixed online-catalog consent to fail closed: omitted consent or explicit `false` exits with code `2` before any network operation, and the wrapper no longer replaces the caller's value with `true`.
- Reduced unauthenticated `GET /tool/v1/status` to exactly `Accepted`, `ProtocolVersion`, and `ToolVersion`; server identity, addresses, bind settings, CIDRs, and client counts are not disclosed. Business endpoints retain authenticated envelopes and rate limiting.
- Moved writable state to `%ProgramData%\ThanhViet-Tool-Kiem-Tra\v4.6`, with `DataSchemaVersion=2.0`, `ProducerVersion`, a migration lock, and machine-readable state. Migration uses a staging copy, SHA-256 verification, transactional commit, and rollback; v4.4/v4.5 data remains unchanged, while old logs/backups are read-only references.
- Added v4.6 launcher, Enterprise agent, and audit mutexes, with launcher-side detection of an active v4.4/v4.5 process before migration. Old cryptographic labels remain only as compatibility identifiers for migrated timeline and secret material.
- Synchronized v4.6 across module/report/safety/capability/catalog metadata, documentation, User-Agent, and verifiers. Added `VERIFY-DATA-LIFECYCLE.ps1` for one-time migration, legacy preservation, idempotency, and rollback fixtures.

## v4.5 — August 6, 2026

- Completed the shared Light/Dark visual system, colored action icons, DPI-aware text layout, and the new product name **Computer Configuration and Software License Check Tool**.
- Inventories all software found through Uninstall Registry data, AppX/MSIX, Start Menu, Desktop, and bounded installed/portable locations; compares licensing models and technical evidence without treating “no evidence” as genuine.
- Added a vendor-neutral deep scan for every detected application: multiple EXE/DLL Authenticode checks, trusted known-bad hashes, artifacts, and correlated system tampering evidence; weighted signature budgeting preserves broad coverage while prioritizing paid/trial/evidence-bearing software, and incomplete coverage is reported explicitly.
- Added **Connect online**, with an explanation and explicit consent before downloading a fixed HTTPS comparison catalog; no application inventory, paths, keys, or tokens are uploaded, and Offline remains the default.
- Lists all other-software results and allows individual or Select-all handling for every Non-genuine/Suspicious scope; backup is mandatory before reset, Repair, cleanup, or manual uninstall/reinstall actions.
- Makes every Non-genuine/Suspicious application manually selectable and adds a generic scope-locked plan for exact artifact quarantine, hosts restoration, validated MSI Repair, or manual uninstall for an official reinstall. Automatic mode never uninstalls software.
- Split scanning into All, Windows and Office, and Other software scopes; extended Backup/Restore to the same scopes; added timeouts, heartbeats, and on-demand HTML/PDF generation to reduce apparent hangs.
- Optimized all 44 embedded payloads by choosing Deflate or raw per resource, then decompressing and verifying SHA-256 before launch without removing a module or reducing scan coverage.
- Rewrote the synchronized Vietnamese/English v4.5 end-user guides in the task-by-task style used by v4.4: what changed, how to run the EXE, all ten tasks, software status, deep scanning, safe remediation, reports, and troubleshooting; packaging internals were removed from the user guide.

## v4.4 — July 31, 2026

- Added safe automatic remediation for allowlisted, backup-capable items, with preview, confirmation, protected backup, and post-scan verification.
- Completed Vietnamese/English localization across the dashboard, dialogs, reports, and child modules while preserving language-neutral machine status codes.

Consistent safety principle: inspection is read-only by default; no telemetry; no unrequested licensing change; remediation requires selection, confirmation, backup, and post-verification.
